Design of CUDA-based [Louvain algorithm] for [community detection].

Community detection involves identifying natural divisions in networks, a crucial task for many large-scale applications. This report presents [GVE-Louvain], one of the most efficient multicore implementations of the Louvain algorithm, a high-quality method for community detection. Running on a dual 16-core Intel Xeon Gold 6226R server, GVE-Louvain outperforms Vite, Grappolo, NetworKit Louvain, and cuGraph Louvain (on an NVIDIA A100 GPU) by factors of `50x`, `22x`, `20x`, and `5.8x`, respectively, achieving a processing rate of `560M` edges per second on a `3.8B`-edge graph. Additionally, it scales efficiently, improving performance by `1.6x` for every thread doubling. The paper also presents **ŒΩ-Louvain**, a GPU-based implementation. When evaluated on an NVIDIA A100 GPU, **ŒΩ-Louvain** performs only on par with GVE-Louvain, largely due to reduced workload and parallelism in later algorithmic passes. These results suggest that CPUs, with their flexibility in handling irregular workloads, may be better suited for community detection tasks.

Below we plot the time taken by [Grappolo] (Louvain), [NetworKit] Louvain, [Nido] (Louvain), [cuGraph] Louvain, and **ŒΩ-Louvain** on 13 different graphs. **ŒΩ-Louvain** surpasses Grappolo, NetworKit Louvain, Nido, and cuGraph Louvain by `20√ó`, `17√ó`, `61√ó`, and `5.0√ó` respectively, achieving a processing rate of `405M` edges/s on a `2.2ùêµ` edge graph.

Below we plot the speedup of **ŒΩ-Louvain** wrt Grappolo, NetworKit Louvain, Nido, and cuGraph Louvain.

Finally, we plot the modularity of communities identified by Grappolo, NetworKit Louvain, Nido, cuGraph Louvain, and **ŒΩ-Louvain**. **ŒΩ-Louvain** on average obtains `1.1%`, `1.2%`, and `1.3%` lower modularity than Grappolo, NetworKit
Louvain, and cuGraph Louvain (where cuGraph Louvain runs), but `45%` higher modularity than Nido.
